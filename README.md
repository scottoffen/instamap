# InstaMap

InstaMap is a high-performance, expression-based object mapping engine designed for maximum flexibility and control. It lets you fluently configure how objects are transformed from one type to another using strongly-typed lambda expressions. Unlike traditional mappers, InstaMap compiles mapping logic once on first use and reuses it without relying on reflection during execution - delivering near-native speed for complex object graphs, collections, dictionaries, primitives, and enums.

Use it when you want:

🔍 Fine-grained control over property-level mappings

⚡ High performance with compiled expression trees

🧩 Custom converters and nested mapping support

🧠 Lazy initialization with optional manual overrides

📦 A lightweight alternative to reflection-heavy mappers
